Without grinding wheat there can be no bread

No alchemy can turn gold into lead

The surgeon has to use the knife and score

The skin in order to affect a cure

To make a coat the tailor cuts the cloth 

A sheep to slaughter makes the festive broth

The builder has to dig the ruins to build

Anything new. The garden’s only filled

With roses when the gardener digs the weeds

And turns the soil to plant the New Year’s seeds

And so my friend, to be remade and whole

Prepare to desecrate your very soul.




## The Power of Renewal

"Renewal from the Fall" is a beautiful and powerful meditation on the importance of transformation and renewal. The poem speaks to the truth that in order to create something new, we must first destroy the old. This can be a painful process, but it is ultimately necessary for growth.

**The Importance of Transformation**

The poem begins with a simple statement: "Without grinding wheat there can be no bread." This line immediately establishes the poem's central theme: that transformation is essential for life. Just as wheat must be ground into flour before it can be made into bread, so too must we undergo transformation in order to grow and evolve.

**Examples of Transformation**

The poem then goes on to explore the different ways in which transformation can take place. The surgeon uses a knife to cure a patient, the tailor cuts cloth to make a coat, and the sheep is slaughtered to make broth. In each of these cases, something old is destroyed in order to create something new.

**Embracing Renewal**

The poem concludes with a powerful message: "And so my friend, to be remade and whole, Prepare to consecrate your very soul." Poet is telling us that in order to experience true renewal, we must be willing to let go of the old and embrace the new. We must be willing to surrender our old ways of thinking and being in order to create a new life for ourselves.


**Renewing Your Own Life**

The poem is a reminder that renewal is always possible. No matter how difficult our lives may seem, we have the power to create a new beginning for ourselves. All we need to do is let go of the past and embrace the future.

**Here are a few tips on how to experience renewal in your own life:**

* **Identify areas for change.** Once you have a good understanding of your life, you can start to identify areas where you would like to make changes. This could be anything from your career to your relationships to your lifestyle habits.
