2023 has been one of the few years in recent when i couldn't watch a lot of movie content. The primary reason being lack of interest in this form of entertainment in general and work stuffs. But here are my top 3 movies of 2023:

## "Oppenheimer" - A Visual and Emotional Explosion

"Oppenheimer" wasn't just a movie; it was a visual poem that exploded across the screen. Cillian Murphy transformed into the famed physicist with such intensity and nuance that it felt like we were peering directly into Oppenheimer's soul. The film wrapped us in the folds of history, making us feel the weight of the world-changing decisions being made. Each scene was a brushstroke in a larger, haunting picture of genius and morality.

## "Jaan-e-Jaan" - A Thrilling Ride of Emotions

"Jaan-e-Jaan" took us on a thrilling ride through the twists and turns of a mother's fight to save her family. Kareena Kapoor Khan brought her character to life with a performance that was both fierce and vulnerable. But it was Jaideep Ahlawat who stole the show. His portrayal of a neighbor caught in the web of crime was so real, so palpable, that you couldn't help but be pulled into his emotional journey. The way he balanced strength with a silent, simmering intensity was nothing short of captivating.

## "Three of Us" - A Journey of Heartfelt Memories

In "Three of Us," the story took us by the hand and led us down a path lined with memories, some sweet, some bitter. Shefali Shah, playing a woman with dementia, performed with such authenticity that you felt her confusion, her fleeting joys, and her struggles. The film was a gentle reminder of the fragility of our memories and how they shape our identities.

Watching these movies was more than just an escape; it was an experience that stayed with us long after the credits rolled. The actors brought their characters to life in a way that felt incredibly real. Their performances didn't just tell storiesâ€”they made us live them. From the raw, complex portrayal by Cillian Murphy to the deeply emotional journey that Jaideep Ahlawat took us on, this year's films were a testament to the power of acting and storytelling.
